    Coca-Cola is the world's most famous and largest-selling soft drink, renowned for its deliciously crisp and refreshing cola taste that has delighted consumers since 1886 and is best served chilled. Its iconic flavor comes from a secret blend of carbonated water, caramel color, and natural flavorings, and it is also available in variants like Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar for those seeking a low or no-calorie option. More than just a beverage, Coca-Cola has become a global symbol that brings a sense of joy and is a popular choice for sharing with friends and family during meals, parties, or simply on its own for a moment of refreshment.
